You Know I still Love You Baby.
And it will never change. (Saranghae)
I want nobody nobody But You, I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another, I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody
Why are you try to, to make me leave you
I know what you're thinking
Baby why aren't you listening
How can I just
Just love someone else and
Forget you completely
When I know you still love me
Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know its not right so
Just stop and come back boy
How can this be
When we were meant to be
I want nobody nobody But You, I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another, I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody
I want nobody nobody But You, I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another, I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody
Why cant we just, just be like this cause
its you that i need and nothing else until the end
Who else can ever make me feel the way I
I feel when I'm with you, no one will ever do
Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know me enough so
you know what I need boy
Right next to you is where I need to be.
I want nobody nobody But You, I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another, I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody
I want nobody nobody But You, I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another, I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody
I don't want no body, body
I don't want no body, body
Honey you know its you that I want, Its you that I need
Why cant you see
I want nobody nobody But You, I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another, I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody
I want nobody nobody But You, I want nobody nobody But You
How can I be with another, I don't want any other
I want nobody nobody nobody nobody
Back to the days when we were so young and wild and free
Nothing else matters other than you and me
so tell me why cant it be
please let me live my life my way
why do you push me away
I don't want nobody nobody nobody nobody but you
